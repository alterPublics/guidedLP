# Guided Label Propagation (GLP)

Large-scale network analysis with semi-supervised community detection for computational social science research.

## Overview

This project provides efficient network analysis capabilities with a focus on **Guided Label Propagation (GLP)**, a novel semi-supervised community detection technique. Unlike traditional unsupervised methods that find arbitrary clusters, GLP identifies how unknown nodes in a network relate to predefined categories of interest (e.g., political affiliation, brand preference, topic relevance).

## Key Features

### 🚀 High-Performance Network Analysis
- **Large-scale optimization**: Designed for networks with 10,000+ nodes
- **NetworkIt backend**: Leverages C++ performance for graph operations  
- **Sparse matrix operations**: Memory-efficient computations using SciPy
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-threaded operations where beneficial

### 🎯 Guided Label Propagation (GLP)
- **Semi-supervised approach**: Uses seed nodes to guide community detection
- **Directional propagation**: Supports both in-degree and out-degree based propagation
- **Probability estimation**: Calculates affinity scores for unknown nodes
- **Validation framework**: Built-in train/test split and external validation

### 📊 Comprehensive Network Toolkit
- **Graph construction**: Unipartite and bipartite networks from edge lists
- **Temporal bipartite projection**: Convert temporal bipartite to directed unipartite with causality preservation
- **Network backboning**: Statistical significance filtering
- **Centrality measures**: Degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality
- **Community detection**: Louvain algorithm integration
- **Temporal analysis**: Time-sliced network evolution

### 🔄 Flexible Data Pipeline
- **Polars integration**: Fast DataFrame operations for large datasets
- **Multiple formats**: Support for CSV, Parquet input/output
- **ID preservation**: Maintains original node identifiers throughout analysis
- **Export options**: GEXF, GraphML, CSV outputs

## Quick Start

### Basic Example

```python
import polars as pl
from guidedLP.network.construction import build_graph_from_edgelist
from guidedLP.glp.propagation import guided_label_propagation

# Load edge list data
edges = pl.read_csv("network_data.csv")

# Build network
graph, id_mapper = build_graph_from_edgelist(
    edges, 
    source_col="user_a", 
    target_col="user_b",
    weight_col="weight"  # optional
)

# Define seed nodes for each community
seed_nodes = {
    "progressive": ["user123", "user456", "user789"],
    "conservative": ["user321", "user654", "user987"]
}

# Run Guided Label Propagation
results = guided_label_propagation(
    graph=graph,
    seeds=seed_nodes,
    id_mapper=id_mapper,
    max_iterations=100,
    threshold=0.01
)

# Export results
export_results(results, "political_affiliation_scores.csv")
print(f"Classified {len(results)} nodes with community probabilities")
```

### Using Test Fixtures

Try the library with sample data:

```python
import polars as pl
import json
from guidedLP.network.construction import build_graph_from_edgelist
from guidedLP.glp.propagation import guided_label_propagation

# Load sample datasets
edges = pl.read_csv("tests/fixtures/sample_edgelist.csv")
with open("tests/fixtures/sample_seeds.json", "r") as f:
    seeds = json.load(f)

# Convert seeds to proper format
seed_nodes = {}
for node, community in seeds.items():
    if community not in seed_nodes:
        seed_nodes[community] = []
    seed_nodes[community].append(node)

# Build graph and run GLP
graph, id_mapper = build_graph_from_edgelist(edges, "source", "target", "weight")
results = guided_label_propagation(graph, seed_nodes, id_mapper)

print(f"Sample analysis complete: {len(results)} nodes classified")
```

## Architecture

The system is organized into three main modules:

```
src/
├── common/          # Shared utilities (ID mapping, validation, export)
├── network/         # Graph construction and analysis
├── glp/            # Guided Label Propagation implementation  
└── timeseries/     # Temporal network analysis
```

### Module Independence
- **Network module**: Standalone graph analysis capabilities
- **GLP module**: Requires network module, adds semi-supervised detection
- **Time-series module**: Temporal analysis, can work with or without GLP

## Performance Characteristics

- **Graph construction**: O(E + V) using NetworkIt
- **Label propagation**: O(I × E) where I is iterations, E is edges
- **Memory usage**: Sparse matrices for networks with >50% zero entries
- **Parallel support**: Multi-threaded centrality calculations and time-slicing

## Examples

### 1. Political Affiliation Analysis

```python
# Analyze political leaning in social networks
from guidedLP.glp.validation import train_test_split_validation
from guidedLP.network.construction import build_graph_from_edgelist

# Load political Twitter network
political_edges = pl.read_csv("political_network.csv")
graph, id_mapper = build_graph_from_edgelist(
    political_edges, "follower", "following"
)

# Define known political accounts as seeds
political_seeds = {
    "progressive": ["@aoc", "@berniesanders", "@ewarren"],
    "conservative": ["@realdonaldtrump", "@tedcruz", "@marcorubio"]
}

# Run validation to test accuracy
accuracy, metrics = train_test_split_validation(
    graph=graph,
    seeds=political_seeds,
    id_mapper=id_mapper,
    test_size=0.2
)

print(f"Political classification accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")
```

### 2. Temporal Network Analysis

```python
# Track community evolution over time
from guidedLP.timeseries.slicing import create_temporal_slices
from guidedLP.timeseries.temporal_metrics import extract_temporal_metrics

# Load temporal network data
temporal_data = pl.read_csv("tests/fixtures/sample_temporal.csv")

# Create time slices
time_slices = create_time_slices(
    temporal_data,
    time_col="timestamp",
    slice_duration="1d"  # daily slices
)

# Analyze each time slice
for date, slice_edges in time_slices.items():
    graph, id_mapper = build_graph_from_edgelist(
        slice_edges, "source", "target", "weight"
    )
    
    results = guided_label_propagation(graph, seeds, id_mapper)
    print(f"{date}: {len(results)} nodes classified")
```

### 3. Academic Collaboration Networks

```python
# Map research communities in citation networks
academic_edges = pl.read_csv("collaboration_network.csv")
graph, id_mapper = build_graph_from_edgelist(
    academic_edges, "author_a", "author_b", "num_collaborations"
)

# Use known department affiliations as seeds
department_seeds = {
    "computer_science": ["researcher1", "researcher2"],
    "biology": ["researcher3", "researcher4"],
    "physics": ["researcher5", "researcher6"]
}

results = guided_label_propagation(graph, department_seeds, id_mapper)

# Analyze interdisciplinary collaboration
for node_id, probabilities in results.items():
    if max(probabilities.values()) < 0.7:  # Low confidence
        print(f"{node_id}: Likely interdisciplinary researcher")
```

### 4. Temporal Bipartite-to-Unipartite Conversion

```python
# Convert user-item interactions to user influence networks  
import polars as pl
from guidedLP.network.construction import temporal_bipartite_to_unipartite

# Load temporal bipartite data (users interacting with items over time)
data = pl.DataFrame({
    "user": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"],
    "item": ["item1", "item1", "item1", "item2", "item2"], 
    "timestamp": ["2024-01-01 09:00", "2024-01-01 11:00", "2024-01-01 13:00",
                  "2024-01-02 10:00", "2024-01-02 15:00"]
})

# Convert to directed user-user influence network  
influence_graph, user_mapper = temporal_bipartite_to_unipartite(
    data,
    source_col="user",
    target_col="item",
    timestamp_col="timestamp",
    intermediate_col="item",    # Items disappear
    projected_col="user",       # Users get connected
    add_edge_weights=True       # Include temporal decay
)

print(f"Created {influence_graph.numberOfNodes()} user influence network")
print(f"Temporal relationships: {influence_graph.numberOfEdges()} edges")

# Expected edges: Alice → Bob → Charlie (temporal precedence preserved)
```
