# Project: Large-Scale Network Analysis with Guided Label Propagation

## Project Context
This is a computational social science project for large-scale network analysis. The core innovation is Guided Label Propagation (GLP), a semi-supervised community detection technique for identifying how unknown nodes in a network relate to known categories of interest.

## Architecture Documentation
Before implementing any code, review:
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` - System design and module structure
- `docs/technical_requirements.md` - Performance and technical constraints
- `docs/reference_implementations.md` - Inspiration
- Relevant specification docs in `docs/specifications/` for detailed function requirements

## Core Technical Requirements
1. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed on large-scale networks (10,000+ nodes)
2. **Primary Framework**: Use NetworkIt for network operations wherever possible
3. **Data Processing**: Use Polars for DataFrame operations (not Pandas)
4. **Numerical Operations**: Use NumPy for matrix calculations
5. **Multiprocessing**: Implement parallel processing when it improves performance
6. **Memory vs Speed**: Default to speed optimization, but provide memory-efficient options

## Implementation Standards
- All network operations must preserve original node IDs from input data
- Support both directed and undirected graphs
- Support weighted edges (single edge only - no multi-edges)
- Never implement multi-layer or multi-edge graphs
- All functions should handle large-scale data (millions of edges)
- Document computational complexity (Big O notation) in docstrings

## Code Organization
- Modular design: network construction, GLP, and time-series should be independent
- Can use OOP, functional, or hybrid approach - choose based on efficiency
- Type hints required for all function signatures
- Comprehensive docstrings with parameter descriptions and return types

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Performance benchmarks for large-scale operations
- Validation tests for GLP accuracy

## Current Development Phase
- Backend API only (no CLI yet)
- Use Jupyter notebooks or test.py scripts for testing
- Plan for future frontend expansion in architecture decisions
